# Classfication for Loan Evaluation
Supervised Learning

## Application Workflow
- Gathered and analyzed data related to automobile loan and divided the data into training and testing datasets
- Constructed a decision tree via computing the information gain recursively , improved the model performance using Random Forest Algorithms(RFA), and predicted the loan status (Approved/Declined)

## Tech Stack
- python
- jupyter notebook

## Requirements
* Python >= 3.1
* Python Libraries: `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib` `sklearn`
